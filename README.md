# ‚ö° EV Charging Environmental Impact API

This FastAPI application calculates key environmental benefits based on energy (in kWh) consumed by electric vehicle (EV) chargers.

It returns:

- ‚úÖ EV miles charged
- ‚úÖ Greenhouse gas emissions saved (CO‚ÇÇ, NO‚ÇÇ, methane, total)
- ‚úÖ Trees‚Äô equivalent CO‚ÇÇ absorption
- ‚úÖ Internal combustion engine (ICE) car miles offset
- ‚úÖ ICE cars taken off the road (monthly equivalent)

# This API has been deployed on Render at:
[Green Energy Calculator](https://green-energy-calculator.onrender.com)

It is slow to start because of free plan.

Use /calculate as the end point for the API.

The API is accessible from any HTTPS website through my CORS policy, so if you want to use this on your own web app, feel free

## üöÄ Getting Started

### üß± Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- `pip` installed

### üì¶ Install Requirements

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   [https://github.com/Ilyasse-B/Green-Energy-Calculator.git]
   cd Green-Energy-Calculator

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install fastapi uvicorn pydantic

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the API Locally

1. Start the API:
    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --reload

2. Open your browser and go to:
    ```bash
    http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
    
3. You‚Äôll see the FastAPI Swagger UI. Scroll down to the POST /calculate endpoint.

4. Click "Try it out" and enter your energy usage like this:
    ```json
    {
        "energy_kwh": 1000
    }
    ```

5. Hit "Execute" to see your results!

### üõ† Developer Notes
The API assumes constant average values across different types of EVs and ICE vehicles.

GHG emissions saved are calculated by comparing EV mileage to ICE equivalents.

Tree absorption is annual, so values represent equivalent annual tree effort.
